Week 1 Chapter 9 Assignment
Name: Eric Flores

    Directions : Answer the following with C++ code.You do not need to compile however you should test the code to make sure there are no syntax errors.



1. Assume the variable diff has already been declared. Write an expression whose value is the address of diff

    Answer: &diff



2. Assume that an int variable diff has already been declared.
    Assume further a variable diffPointer of type "pointer to int" has also already been declared.
    Write a statement that assigns the address of diff to diffPointer

    Answer: diffPointer = &diff;




3. Assume that an int variable counter has already been declared.Assume further a variable counterPointer of type "pointer to int" has also already been declared.
    Write a statement that makes counterPointer "point" to counter.


    Answer: counterPointer = &counter;




4. Assume that ip1, ip2, and ip3 have already been declared to be of type "pointer to int".Assume further that each of these pointer variables have been initialized-- 
    each points to some int variable.
    Write a statement that computes the sum of the variables that ip1 and ip2 point to, and assigns that value(the sum) to the variable that ip3 points to


    Answer: ip3 = ip1 + *ip2;





 6. Assume that strikeCounter has already been declared to be a "pointer to int".
    Assume further that strikeCounter has been initialized-- its value is the address of some int variable.
    Write a statement that assigns the value 27 to the variable that strikeCounter is pointing to.


    Answer: *strikeCounter = 27;
