Week 3 Chapter 10 Assignment
Name: Eric Flores
Directions:
Answer the following with C++ code.  You do not need to compile however you should test the code to make sure there are no syntax errors. 
1.	Write a full class definition for a class named Player, and containing the following members:
•  A data member name of type string.
•  A data member score of type int.
•  A member function called setName that accepts a parameter and assigns it to name. The function returns no value.
•  A member function called setScore that accepts a parameter and assigns it to score. The function returns no value.
•  A member function called getName that accepts no parameters and returns the value of name.
•  A member function called getScore that accepts no parameters and returns the value of score.

    Answer:
                class Player{
                    public:
                    void setName (string a){
                    name = a;}
                    void setScore (int b){
                    score = b;}
                    string getName(){
                    return name;}
                    int getScore(){
                    return score;}

                    private:
                    string name;
                    int score;
                    };




2. Write a full class definition for a class named ContestResult, and containing the following members:
•	A data member winner of type string, initialized to the empty string.
•	A data member secondPlace of type string, initialized to the empty string.
•	A data member thirdPlace of type string, initialized to the empty string.
•	A member function called setWinner that has one parameter, whose value it assigns to the data member winner.
•	A member function called setSecondPlace that has one parameter, whose value it assigns to the data member secondPlace.
•	A member function called setThirdPlace that has one parameter, whose value it assigns to the data member thirdPlace.
•	A member function called getWinner that has no parameters and that returns the value of the data member winner.
•	A member function called getSecondPlace that has no parameters and that returns the value of the data member secondPlace.
•	A member function called getThirdPlace that has no parameters and that returns the value of the data member thirdPlace.


    Answer:     
                class ContestResult
                    {
                    private:
                    string winner="";
                    string secondPlace="";
                    string thirdPlace="";

                    public:
                    void setWinner(string a){ winner=a;}
                    void setSecondPlace(string b){secondPlace=b;}
                    void setThirdPlace(string c){thirdPlace=c;}

                    string getWinner() {return winner;}
                    string getSecondPlace() {return secondPlace;}
                    string getThirdPlace() {return thirdPlace;}

                    };
