Instructions
1.  Write the definition of a function divide that takes four arguments and returns no value. The first two arguments are of type int. 
    The last two arguments arguments are pointers to int and are set by the function to the quotient and remainder of dividing the first argument by the second argument. 
    The function does not return a value.

The function can be used as follows:

	int numerator=42, denominator=5, quotient, remainder;
	divide(numerator,denominator,&quotient,&remainder);
	/* quotient is now 8 */
	/* remainder is now 2 */

        Answer:
                #include <iostream>
                using namespace std;

                void divide(int numerator,int denominator,int* quotient, int* remainder){
                *quotient=numerator/denominator;
                *remainder=numerator%denominator;
                }
                int main() {
                int numerator=42, denominator=5, quotient, remainder;
                divide(numerator, denominator, &quotient, &remainder);
                cout<<quotient<<endl<<remainder;
                return 0;
                }



2.  zeroIt is a function that takes one argument and returns no value. 
    The argument is a pointer to int. The function stores the value 0 back into the variable pointed to by the argument.
    x is an int variable that has been declared. Write a statement that sets the value stored in x to zero by invoking the function zeroIt.

    Answer: 
                zeroIt(&x);

                void zeroIt(int *x) 
                    {
                        *x = 0;
                    }
