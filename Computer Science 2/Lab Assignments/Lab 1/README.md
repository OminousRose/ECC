 Code directions: 
 
 Write a function that takes a C-string as a parameter and reverses thestring. The function will use two pointers to char, front and rear. The front pointer will initially reference the first character in the string, and the rear pointer will initially reference the last character in the string. Reverse thestring by swapping the characters referenced by front and rear pointers, then increment the front pointer and decrement the rear pointer, and so on, until the entire string is reversed. Write a main program that would let the user input a string and then print out the reversed version of the string. For this exercise, you may assume the maximum length of a string is 100 characters.
