Week 3 Lab

Directions:  Write the code for the following using your chosen IDE.  Submit a screen print showing the 
program running along with the .cpp file.


Define a class called Odometer that will be used to track fuel and mileage
for a vehicle. Include member variables to track the distance driven (in miles) and the fuel efficiency of the vehicle (in miles per gallon). The class will
have a constructor that accepts one parameter and initializes distance to 0 and fuel efficiency to the value of its parameter. Include a member function to
reset the odometer to 0 miles, a member function that accepts the miles driven for a trip and adds it to the odometer's total, and a member function that
returns the number of gallons of gasoline that the vehicle has consumed since the odometer was last reset.

Use your Odometer class in a program that would ask the user to input fuel efficiency and then create an Odometer object using your constructor to
initialize the member variables to their appropriate values. Then the program would ask the user to input the miles driven for two trips and output the
gallons of gas the vehicle consumed on these two trips. Then it will reset the odometer and repeat the procedure for two more trips.
