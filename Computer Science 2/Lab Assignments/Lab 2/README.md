Week 2 Programming Lab

Directions:  Write the code for the following using your chosen IDE.  Submit a screen print showing the 
program running along with the .cpp file.  


Code directions:
Write a program that produces a histogram of student grades for an
assignment. The program must allow the user to input each student's grade as an integer until the user inputs -1. The program will store user's input in a
vector (covered in Chapter 8). Then the program will allocate the memory for the histogram such that the histogram is able to hold all values from 0 to the
maximum grade found in the vector. After this, the program will compute the histogram and print the histogram to standard output.
