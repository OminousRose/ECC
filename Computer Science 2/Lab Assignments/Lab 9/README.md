Write a declaration for the Complex class from the Practice Program 3
from Chapter 11. The class will represent complex numbers; include
declarations for two int member variables, real_part and imaginary_part to
store the real part and imaginary part respectively. Also include prototypes
for the constructors as described in 11.3. Furthermore, include the prototypes
for the operators ==, +, -, *, >>, and <<.

Write definitions for the member functions of the Complex class you
declared earlier. Make sure to write the definitions outside the class, i.e.
as if they were in a separate file.

Finally, write a main function to demonstrate your Complex class; the
main function will prompt the user to enter two complex numbers and then
display whether they are equal and their sum, difference, and product.
