Declare a class named Rational from the Programming Project 2 from
Chapter 11. The class will have two member variables of type int to represent
the numerator and denominator of a rational number. Include the prototypes for
all constructors and operators described in the original problem
specification. Also, overload the operators =, +=, -=, *=, /=, +, -, *, /, <,
>, ==, !=, <=, >=, <<, >> so that they apply to the Rational class.

Define the member functions of class Rational that you have declared
earlier. Make sure to write the definitions outside the class, i.e. as if
they were in a separate file.

Write a test program that would make use of your Rational class to
prompt the user to input two rational numbers and then output the sum,
difference, product, and quotient of the two numbers, as well as the results
of the relational operators.
