This project consists of two programs.

The first program is a classic game of Tic Tac Toe. Within the program, we go over concepts such as matrices, boolean logic (game logic), vectors, etc. Game ends when there's a winner.

The second program is a restaurant simulation. This restaurant is open 24/7 and can only seat one customer at a time. Customers will be read a list of customers in front of them in alphabetical order. The condition when the program ends is when the size of the wait queue is more than 5. The program will take in customer names and prepare them dishes based on what they select. Once the customer in restaurant is done, they check out and move on to the next customer that comes in or whom is waiting. This program covers concepts such as queues, stack, recursion, etc.
